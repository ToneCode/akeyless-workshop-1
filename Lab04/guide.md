# Cleanup

In this lab we will run the pipeline one more time and select the `destroy` action.

## 1. Run the GitHub Actions Workflow

Go to the Actions tab, select the `Manage EKS Cluster` workflow and click the drop down button `Run workflow` and then type `destroy` then click the button `Run workflow`.

## 2. Check the AWS Console [Optional]

Wait about 25 minutes or so and if you wish, you could log into the AWS console and see your EKS cluster is removed.
